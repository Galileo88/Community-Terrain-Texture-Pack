# Community Terrain Texture Pack v1.0.5

This is a set of textures to be used with Kopernicus to help modders create high quality, immersive terrain for their planet pack. It's a resource for the modding community, so feel free to add textures to the pack via pull request.

To contribute, all textures must:
  * Be in DXT5 DDS format
  * Include both color (alpha channel for specularity) and normal maps
  * Be no larger than 2048x2048 

**Do not change or remove any textures currently included in CTTP.**
 
**Changelog**

v1.0.5

- Correctly balance alpha channel luminosity values for use with the AtmosphericTriplanarZoomRotation shader, courtesy of Niako.

v1.0.4

- KSP 1.5.* release. Modified versioning so that any version of KSP is supported to allow for other mods to correctly function via CKAN & AVC correctly.

v1.0.3

- Repathed all textures with GameData/CTTP/Textures/PluginData folder to ensure further extensibility and ensure file extension issue with Kopernicus does not occur.
